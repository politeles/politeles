      <description>Caffe is a library used in deep learning and specific to computer vision. They provide an installation guide, which is quite nice. But I experienced problems during the install. You can download the source code in https://github.com/BVLC/caffe
First follow the installation instructions.
I had installed cuda 8 library directly from Nvidia and not from ubuntu default repos.
Then install the following packages: sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev libopencv-dev libhdf5-serial-dev protobuf-compiler sudo apt-get install &amp;ndash;no-install-recommends libboost-all-dev</description>

      <description>Getting started with docker in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I&amp;rsquo;m trying to install a small lab system based on Ubuntu. The Docker project is a new step on the virtualization world, which reduces the amount of resources used by the &amp;lsquo;guest O.S&amp;rsquo; since there is no such O.S.
To get an overview on Docker, I recommend to get to the project page and get the resources and the free (an really good) training from there (https://www.</description>

I want to learn and work with some of the newest &amp;lsquo;Big Data&amp;rsquo; tools, like Hadoop, Mahout, Flume, Elastic, etc. But how to do that? Which tecnology should I work with? Is there like a faction of people that only work with Apache products, other just with Amazon. To choose, and experiment with those technologies I&amp;rsquo;m going to set up a budget lab at home.</description>

      <description>SSH authentication with keys Handling errors on ssh authentication.
If you have ssh authentication with public / private keys, sometimes you might face the issue, that even when the authorized_keys contains your public key on the target host, the system is asking the password.
Some things you can try: - Copy your public key by using ssh-copy-id command. - Check permissions: the target home folder should be at least 75x, so the group can&amp;rsquo;t write.</description>

      <description>Hi there, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to install java development tools on my ubuntu, I skim through several guides, but none of them convinced me. All links I saw just consist on adding a repository to your apt, and then install with apt from there. But I prefer to have a deep understanding. So I went to the official download page for Java 8. And I downloaded the image called linux-x64.tar.gz The release instructions are here.</description>

      <description>I faced the issue that compass was not working on windows 7 64 bits and I solved by installing ruby and then the compass gem. Depending on your system, you can download ruby here: http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ Then don&amp;rsquo;t forget to set up the environment variables on windows I think you can do that directly from the installer, but also from Computer -&amp;gt; Control Panel -&amp;gt; Edit Environment Variables. Then on System Variables, add to the Path variable the ruby path,  Finally open a CMD terminal and write:</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;ve been fighting the whole day for the security constraint that makes your browser blocks your JS code when trying to reach an external server. Thas was solved on the standard Cross Origin Resource Sharing. (CORS for short). In my node JS server code I had to adapt the following:
//enable Cross Origin Resource Sharingapp.use(function(req, res, next) {res.header(&amp;#34;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;*&amp;#34;);res.header(&amp;#39;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS&amp;#39;);res.header(&amp;#34;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept&amp;#34;);next();});  and on my Jquery I did:</description>

But the working thing to me is the following: 1. First push the empty config file to your repo. 1. Then tell git to ignore the updates on that file</description>

There are 2 possibilities, one is to perform the search online, that is, to lookup the files and do the search while querying. This is reported as not being as efficient as do an offline index.
So I build an index, based on json, using a python script.
Basically the json I wanted to create looks like this:</description>

But, it looks like there are no standard functions to parse html files, so I found BeautifulSoup library to process html entities http://www.</description>

      <description>I recovered an old post from 2012 on my previous blog. Here I translated and updated the post.
Working with dates is not an easy task in a programming language. Usually, because there is no standard (like it happens on databases) or sometimes, the standard is not implemented. On 2012 I talked that joda time was planned to be the new data standard on Java, and in fact, in 2015, Joda time is the facto standard ( as they claim on their site): Joda-Time is the de facto standard date and time library for Java.</description>

First of all, it&amp;rsquo;s important to know whether mongo server is running or not. In windows, you may run it as a service. But in this case, I&amp;rsquo;ll run it in foreground: C:\Users\JoseEnriqueP&amp;amp;gt;mongod &amp;ndash;dbpath .</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m leading AI and Machine Learning strategy. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in how these techniques can be applied to the enterprise environment. Usually, enterprises are big and slow, therefore, the adoption of these technologies is different than in a start-up. The main challenges we have today is dealing with data sources, data versioning, data security and privacy and the implementation of an effective workflow to work with.
