<p>I’m trying to install a small lab system based on Ubuntu. The Docker project is a new step on the virtualization world, which reduces the amount of resources used by the ‘guest O.S’ since there is no such O.S.</p>

<p>To get an overview on Docker, I recommend to get to the project page and get the resources and the free (an really good) training from there (<a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">https://www.docker.com/</a>)</p>

<p>I’m going to follow the instructions on the site to <a href="http://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/">install docker for linux</a>, but I’d like to detail here the problems and the full install I did.</p>

<p>Get to a console and install with the Ubuntu script:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo  </span>wget <span class="nt">-qO-</span> https://get.docker.com/ | sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next you can add your own user to run Docker without root or sudo.
To do so:
If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider adding your user to the “docker” group with something like:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="nb">sudo </span>usermod <span class="nt">-aG</span> docker jpons

Remember that you will have to log out and back <span class="k">in for </span>this to take effect!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Trying to run hello world:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker run hello-world
Post http:///var/run/docker.sock/v1.19/containers/create: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: no such file or directory. Are you trying to connect to a TLS-enabled daemon without TLS?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Don’t forget to start the Docker server, otherwise even the hello world app won’t start.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>jpons@bugambilla:~<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>docker run hello-world
Unable to find image <span class="s1">'hello-world:latest'</span> locally
latest: Pulling from hello-world

Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the <span class="s2">"hello-world"</span> image from the Docker Hub.
    <span class="o">(</span>Assuming it was not already locally available.<span class="o">)</span>
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 <span class="nv">$ </span>docker run <span class="nt">-it</span> ubuntu bash
