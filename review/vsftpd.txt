Installation and configuration of Vsftpd with virtual users and SSL certificates.

We want to install a ftp server with virtual users and SSL certificates. There are several configuration files that we need to configure.
The main configuration file for vsftpd is usually located at /etc/vsftpd.conf 

The first point is the configuration of virtual users, that is, no system users will log onto this system.
To do so, we need to configure an authentication mechanism, we will work with a module from PAM to authenticate virtual users.

We have to create a PAM service using pam_pwdfile.so and the generated /etc/vsftpd/.passwd file. In this example we create a PAM policy for vsftpd with the following content:

/etc/pam.d/vsftpd
auth required pam_pwdfile.so pwdfile /etc/vsftpd/.passwd
account required pam_permit.so

Next, the user related configuration on /etc/vsftpd.conf


# Virtual users configuration
# pointing to the correct PAM service file
pam_service_name=vsftpd
write_enable=YES
hide_ids=YES
listen=YES
#connect_from_port_20=YES
anonymous_enable=NO
local_enable=YES
dirmessage_enable=YES
xferlog_enable=YES
chroot_local_user=YES
# passwd_chroot_enable=yes

user_config_dir=/etc/vsftpd_user_conf
guest_enable=YES
guest_username=virtual
virtual_use_local_privs=YES


With this configuration, we configure each virtual user with two files, one for the passwords and another with the properties, i.e. the home folder.
So all passwords are encrypted with OpenSSL algorithm:

With this command you get the password:

openssl passwd -1

[root@archpepex /]# openssl passwd -1 -noverify paquillo
$1$Mueh8aru$ejQWwyL9ZKiT/fe5ubpZE0

then add this info to the password file located in /etc/vsftpd/.passwd That file should looks like:

[root@archpepex /]# cat /etc/vsftpd/.passwd
paquillo:785DLoWKQK6oU
manolo:$1$Z8GKEXx7$h5Tq2RWBkEE02uv.xf1pN.
manolito:ozh3acxyO/Kq2

Then we need a file to configure a user, as stated on the vsftp.conf file, for user paquillo,
we should edit this file: /etc/vsftpd_user_conf/paquillo

[root@archpepex /]# cat /etc/vsftpd_user_conf/paquillo
write_enable=YES
allow_writeable_chroot=YES
chroot_local_user=YES
local_root=/srv/ftp/paquillo

You can adapt the local root folder as desired.

To work with SSL but allow only TSL v1 and higher, then we write the following:
# SSL MANAGEMENT
ssl_enable=YES

#choose what you like, if you accept anon-connections
# you may want to enable this
allow_anon_ssl=YES

#choose what you like,
# it's a matter of performance i guess
# force_local_data_ssl=NO

#choose what you like
force_local_logins_ssl=YES

# Select which SSL ciphers vsftpd will allow for encrypted SSL connections (required by FileZilla)
ssl_ciphers=HIGH
# Disable SSL session reuse (required by WinSCP)
require_ssl_reuse=NO


#you should at least enable this if you enable ssl...
ssl_tlsv1=YES
#choose what you like
ssl_sslv2=NO
#choose what you like
ssl_sslv3=NO
#give the correct path to your currently generated *.pem file
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.pem
#the *.pem file contains both the key and cert
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.pem


Note that the certificate files can be created with openSSL. You can generate a certificate by executing this:

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 7300 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.pem -out /etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.pem
