Handling errors on ssh authentication.

If you have ssh authentication with public / private keys, sometimes you might face the issue,
that even when the authorized_keys contains your public key on the target host, the system is asking the password.


Some things you can try:
- Copy your public key by using ssh-copy-id command.
- Check permissions: the target home folder should be at least 75x, so the group can't write.
- you can debug the output of the ssh authentication command by:
