      <description>How to get times from curl We want to do a POST query to Webex APIs, and we want to measure the response time. To do that, we need to write a config file:
{\n&amp;#34;time_redirect&amp;#34;: %{time_redirect},\n&amp;#34;time_namelookup&amp;#34;: %{time_namelookup},\n&amp;#34;time_connect&amp;#34;: %{time_connect},\n&amp;#34;time_appconnect&amp;#34;: %{time_appconnect},\n&amp;#34;time_pretransfer&amp;#34;: %{time_pretransfer},\n&amp;#34;time_starttransfer&amp;#34;: %{time_starttransfer},\n&amp;#34;time_total&amp;#34;: %{time_total},\n&amp;#34;size_request&amp;#34;: %{size_request},\n&amp;#34;size_upload&amp;#34;: %{size_upload},\n&amp;#34;size_download&amp;#34;: %{size_download},\n&amp;#34;size_header&amp;#34;: %{size_header}\n}\nSave it as curlFormat.txt, then you can run your curl query as</description>

      <description>Cut/copy and paste using visual selection Visual selection is a common feature in applications, but Vim&amp;rsquo;s visual selection has several benefits.
To cut-and-paste or copy-and-paste:
Position the cursor at the beginning of the text you want to cut/copy.Press v to begin character-based visual selection, or V to select whole lines, or Ctrl-v or Ctrl-q to select a block.Move the cursor to the end of the text to be cut/copied.</description>

I want to learn and work with some of the newest &amp;lsquo;Big Data&amp;rsquo; tools, like Hadoop, Mahout, Flume, Elastic, etc. But how to do that? Which tecnology should I work with? Is there like a faction of people that only work with Apache products, other just with Amazon. To choose, and experiment with those technologies I&amp;rsquo;m going to set up a budget lab at home.</description>

      <description>SSH authentication with keys Handling errors on ssh authentication.
If you have ssh authentication with public / private keys, sometimes you might face the issue, that even when the authorized_keys contains your public key on the target host, the system is asking the password.
Some things you can try:
 Copy your public key by using ssh-copy-id command. Check permissions: the target home folder should be at least 75x, so the group can&amp;rsquo;t write.</description>

All links I sawjust consist on adding a repository to your apt, and then install with apt from there. But I prefer to have a deep understanding. So I went to the official download page for Java 8.And I downloaded the image called linux-x64.tar.gzThe release instructions are here.</description>

      <description>I faced the issue that compass was not working on windows 7 64 bits and I solved by installing ruby and then the compass gem. Depending on your system, you can download ruby here: http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ Then don&amp;rsquo;t forget to set up the environment variables on windows I think you can do that directly from the installer, but also from Computer -&amp;gt; Control Panel -&amp;gt; Edit Environment Variables. Then on System Variables, add to the Path variable the ruby path, Finally open a CMD terminal and write:</description>

There are very sofisticated proposals: Git Tools - Interactive Stagingwhen you have secret key in your project, how can pushing to GitHub be possible?But the working thing to me is the following:
 First push the empty config file to your repo. Then tell git to ignore the updates on that file  Jose Enrique@MORTIMER /C/Users/Jose Enrique/Documents/nodejs_mongo/nodejs_mongo_ server (master) $ git update-index --assume-unchanged config/config.</description>

      <description>Hi again, this is going to be a small configuration guide for mongo DB on windows. There are a few steps missing on the official instalation guide. To sum up the steps are the following:
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you plan to run MongoDB server as windows service: &amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Open windows firewall for your network for mongoDB&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Create a configuration file  So you get an error. That&amp;rsquo;s due to the windows firewall. Allow traffic from mongodb and you will be able to connect.</description>

There are some tools to analyze the memory usage like passenger-memory-stats. In my system the output is something like:
The other tool for the administration is passenger-status:
Once you select the passenger process, you can dig in deeper:
you can connect to the administration console, via curl. If you don&amp;rsquo;t get any answer, that means that your server is frozen.</description>

      <description>I recovered an old post from 2012 on my previous blog. Here I translated and updated the post.
Working with dates is not an easy task in a programming language. Usually, because there is no standard (like it happens on databases) or sometimes, the standard is not implemented. On 2012 I talked that joda timewas planned to be the new data standard on Java, and in fact, in 2015, Joda time is the facto standard ( as they claim on their site):</description>
