I'm leading AI and Machine Learning strategy. I'm interested in how these techniques can be applied to the enterprise environment. 
Usually, enterprises are big and slow, therefore, the adoption of these technologies is different than in a start-up. The main challenges we have today is dealing with data sources, data versioning, data security and privacy and the implementation of an effective workflow to work with.


I am Doctor in Computer Science by University of Granada (Spain) and by Ghent University (Belgium).


 
## Research

My research field are Relational Databases. Moreover I am interested on Fuzzy Temporal Databases [click here to read my Ph. D Thesis](https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/4127557).
I'm moving forward to the Big Data field. I am studying the tools and the cutting-edge technologies like Apache Hadoop, R, Cassandra, Mongo DB, Redis, Nuo DB.

 
## Engineering

Currently I'm working for T-Systems International as Automation Architect.
I work with many different systems like SAP, RPA solutions, NodeJs APIs, and of course data science and AI/ML techniques.
